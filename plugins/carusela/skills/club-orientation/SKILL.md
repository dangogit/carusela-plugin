name: club-orientation
description: Read this before the first write to a Carusela club. Explains what the MCP can and cannot do, why a refusal is usually correct, and how to pick the right club. Use whenever a Carusela tool is about to be called for the first time in a session, when a tool refuses a field, or when somebody asks what Claude can change in their club.

# Carusela orientation

## What this skill forbids

**Never treat a refusal as a bug to route around.**

Every field the Carusela MCP refuses is refused on purpose, and the refusal message names where
that thing actually lives. `update_club_copy` will not set a colour, a price or a feature flag.
That is not a missing feature you should work around by finding another tool. It is the surface
telling you the change belongs somewhere else, usually because it decides money or access.

If a refusal blocks the user's goal, the answer is to say so and name the right door. Never a
workaround.

**Never write before you have read the club's config.** `get_config` is one call and it tells
you the brand, the tiers, the enabled features, the navigation and the mentor. Half the mistakes
in this surface come from writing into a club whose shape you assumed.

**Never guess `club_id`.** If the account reaches more than one club, every tool requires it and
guessing puts a lesson in a stranger's club. Call `list_my_clubs`, and if more than one comes
back and the user has not said which, ask.

**Never treat "yes" in the chat as the authorization.** Every gated write on this server spends a
single-use token that only its preview or confirm tool can mint. The person's yes is what lets you
make that call; the token is what the server checks. A spender called without its token is
refused, and it should be.

## The one thing to do first

```
list_my_clubs            -> which clubs, and the id for every later call
get_config               -> brand, tokens, features, navigation, mentor
get_club_overview        -> how much of each content type exists, published vs draft
```

Three read-only calls. They cost nothing and they answer most of what you were about to guess.

## The tool map, by job

| The user wants to | Tools |
|---|---|
| See what exists | `get_club_overview`, `list_content`, `get_config`, `get_member_stats` |
| Add or edit a course | `manage_course` (lessons come with it, in the same call) |
| Add a recording, tutorial, guide or AI agent | `manage_library_item` |
| Add an event or a group | `manage_event`, `manage_group` |
| Organise | `manage_category`, `set_content_visibility` |
| Change words | `update_club_copy` |
| Change colours, logos or the home page's block order | `preview_design_change` then `publish_design` |
| Bring in a video or upload a file | `attach_media` |
| Bring in members from another system | `import_members` |
| See what is for sale, and whether the club can sell | `get_commerce_catalog`, `get_commerce_changes`, `get_commerce_readiness` |
| Set a price, an offer, a trial, a coupon or a member tier | `manage_offer`, `manage_coupon`, `manage_membership_tier`, then `preview_commerce_changes` and `apply_commerce_changes` |
| Build a Sales page and its Funnel | see `build-sales-funnel` |
| See what has been done | `get_audit_log` |

## The three rings, in one paragraph each

**Ring A is words.** Club name, tagline, page headings, the mentor's text, copy fragments,
outbound links. `update_club_copy` writes them and the platform publishes them on write, with no
second step. That is how the platform is built, and it is not a reason to skip asking: if the
user has not told you what the new wording should be, get it from them before you write it. What
the ring being ungated means is that a wrong word is cheap to correct, not that nobody needs to
see it.

**Ring B is design.** Colours, brand assets and the home page's block composition. It needs a
human to look at it first, so it has two steps: `preview_design_change` stages a draft and returns
a single-use token plus a link a person can open, and `publish_design` spends that token. There is
no way to publish design without previewing. The home page's `home_blocks` is a whole-list
replace: read the current list with `get_config` and send all of it, because a block you leave out
is removed. See `brand-a-club`.

**Ring C is money and access.** Prices, offers, trials, instalments, coupons and member tiers.
Only an owner or an admin of the club can call these tools, and they write in two steps:

1. **Stage.** `manage_offer`, `manage_membership_tier` and `manage_coupon` each take the
   complete desired values, never a patch, plus a `request_id` you reuse on a retry. Staging
   changes nothing a member can see: a new resource stays unpublished or inactive, and an
   existing live one is untouched until apply. To revise a staged draft, pass its `draft_id`
   with its exact `expected_revision`; `get_commerce_changes` lists your open drafts.
2. **Preview, then apply.** `preview_commerce_changes` takes the draft revisions (and,
   optionally, Sales page ids and draft course ids to publish in the same batch) and returns the
   exact proposal, a buyer preview, the club's selling readiness and a confirmation token that
   expires after 10 minutes. Show the person the proposal. `apply_commerce_changes` spends that
   token only after they approve it. The batch applies whole or not at all; if a resource or a
   draft moved since the preview, it is refused and you preview again.

What the server checks before it stages anything: an offer sells exactly one product (a member
tier or a course), its price is a whole number of agorot, its interval is `one_time`, `monthly`
or `yearly`, a one-time offer has no trial days, instalments are allowed only on a one-time offer
and then need at least 2. A percent coupon cannot exceed 100; a fixed one is in agorot. A member
tier here is the club's own membership level, not the platform package the club pays Carusela
for.

**What stays human-only in Ring C: connecting the club's CardCom terminal.** A person does it by
hand in the admin payments tab, `/admin?tab=payments`, and the terminal credentials never pass
through MCP. `get_commerce_readiness` says where the club stands: `ready`, `not_connected`,
`not_synchronized` or `unknown`. Drafts can be prepared in every state; `can_publish_paid_offers`
is true only when the status is `ready`. Read it before promising anybody a paid offer, and when
it is not ready, send the owner to the payments tab rather than looking for another way. Nothing
in Ring C charges a member or refunds one.

Sales pages and Funnels sit on top of Ring C. Each has its own token gate, or a Sales page and its
saved Funnel draft can go live inside the same approved commercial batch. See `build-sales-funnel`.

**Feature flags are the owner's, in the admin.** Whether the community, groups, events, the AI
mentor or the agents page is on is switched in the admin under "יכולות המועדון", `/admin?tab=features`.
MCP reads them through `get_config` and refuses to create content behind a flag that is off; it
does not flip one. The door is that tab, not "ask Carusela".

## What MCP will never do, so stop looking

- Charge a member, refund one, or connect or change the payment terminal
- Apply a commercial change, publish a Sales page or a Funnel, or start or end an A/B test without
  the single-use token from a preview or confirm step the person approved
- Switch a feature flag
- Reorder the navigation rail
- Touch a repository, a deployment, DNS or a domain
- Read a member's contact details outside the member tools that hold the `member_pii` capability

Each has a real door: the admin payments tab for the terminal, the preview or confirm tool for a
token, the features tab for flags, the admin CHROME tab for the rail. Tell the user which door,
and say plainly that this surface will not do it. Then carry on with the part you can do. A
refusal the user cannot act on is worse than no answer, so the door is the part that matters.

## Three traps that cost real time

**Features can be off, and the surface will tell you.** A club with `features.groups: false` has
no groups area, and `manage_group` now REFUSES to create one rather than leaving an invisible row
behind. Read that refusal as information: the owner switches the flag on at `/admin?tab=features`,
and the refusal names the switch. Ask them to flip it, then create the content. `get_config` shows
which features are on before you plan around one.

**Before Launch, a created course or library item is published, not a draft.** Nobody can reach a
pre-launch club, so the draft would hide the work from the owner rather than protect a member;
after Launch the old per-kind defaults return. `manage_course` says which happened in
`publish_default`. See `seed-club-content`.

**Categories for recordings, tutorials and guides are not a `category` field.** Those three
join a category by carrying its exact name in `tags`. `manage_library_item` refuses `category`
for them, correctly, because the column does not exist. See `seed-club-content`.

## Everything is logged

Every call lands in `get_audit_log` with `source: "mcp"`, including the ones that failed and the
arguments they carried. Use it at the start of a session to see what a previous session already
did, rather than repeating it. Emails in the arguments are redacted; that is deliberate.

## When you are done

Do not report success from the tool result alone. `get_club_overview` after a batch tells you
how many items are published versus draft, and that is the number the user actually cares about.
`audit-club-content` is the fuller version of that check.
