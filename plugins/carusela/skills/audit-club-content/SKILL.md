name: audit-club-content
description: Find what is silently wrong in a Carusela club - content nobody can see, categories attached to nothing, missing thumbnails, ungated material and surfaces that are switched off. Use after a bulk import, before a launch, or when somebody says the club looks empty or a member cannot find something.

# Audit club content

## What this skill forbids

**Never fix a finding by deleting.** Almost everything this audit turns up is content that
exists and is merely invisible: a draft, an empty category, a wrong tag. The fix is to publish
it, attach it or rename it. Deleting removes the owner's work to make a report look clean.

**Never report a clean audit you did not run.** Each check below is a real call. If one could
not run, say which and why.

## Why this exists

The failures this surface produces are quiet ones. Nothing errors. The tool returns success, the
owner believes they shipped, and the thing is invisible to every member. This is the list of
ways that happens.

## The checks

### 1. Content that exists and nobody can see

```
get_club_overview
```

Compare `total` against `published` for every type. Anything with a gap has drafts.

Then the reason for the gap, which is not the same for every type:

- **recordings and tutorials are created as drafts.** If a batch was imported and never
  published, this is why.
- **guides and AI agents are created live.** A gap here means somebody unpublished on purpose.
- **groups have no published state at all.** `is_private` is their only axis.

### 2. Surfaces that are switched off

```
get_config  ->  published.features
```

If `groups` is false, every group is invisible. If `community` is false, so is the feed and
everything on it. `manage_group` refuses to create into a switched-off surface, so nothing NEW
lands there, but anything created before that refusal existed is still sitting where nobody can
see it. That is what this check is for.

Feature flags are the owner's to flip, in the admin under "יכולות המועדון". MCP does not flip
them. If content sits behind a false flag, the finding names that tab: "switch X on under
יכולות המועדון, then the content shows".

### 3. Categories attached to nothing

```
manage_category  action: "list"  scope: "recording"
manage_category  action: "list"  scope: "course"
```

For each one, check whether anything actually carries it:

- **courses, groups and AI agents** carry a real `category` field. Compare against
  `list_content`.
- **recordings, tutorials and guides** join by carrying the category's **exact name** in `tags`.
  A near miss attaches nothing and looks fine from both sides.

The cheap way to see the truth: `manage_category action: "delete"` **without** `confirm`. It
refuses and reports the usage count across the whole pool. It is a read that looks like a write,
and it is the only place the counts surface.

Do not pass `confirm: true` while auditing.

### 4. Videos with no poster frame

```
list_content  type: "tutorial"
```

Every kind that carries a video resolves its own poster frame on write now, so a null
`thumbnail_url` beside a `video_url` means the resolver could not reach the provider at the time
of writing, not that the kind does not do it. Fix with an update that re-sends the same
`video_url`; resolution runs again and fills the empty value.

For items with no `video_url` at all, that fix does not apply; there is nothing to resolve a
frame from. If `generate_missing_covers` is available for this club, that is the fix: see
`seed-club-content`'s Covers section for how to run it (dry run, ask once, batches, and what
each stop reason means).

### 5. Everything at one tier

```
get_club_overview                                    -> access_tiers
list_content  type: "course"  min_tier_level: 0
```

If a club has paid tiers and every item sits at level 0, the paid tiers buy nothing. That is
usually an oversight after an import rather than a decision. Report it as a question, not a fix.

Check courses and their lessons separately: gating a course does not cascade to its lessons.

### 6. Events in the past

```
list_content  type: "event"
```

A home page with an upcoming-events block and only past events renders an empty block. Worth
telling the owner even though nothing is broken.

### 7. Another platform's ids showing to members

```
list_content  type: "course"
list_content  type: "tutorial"
list_content  type: "guide"
```

Read `tag` on every item. Flag anything that is a reference rather than a word a member should
read: `vendor:12345` (`schooler:45334`, `rav-messer:…`), a bare number, a URL. After an
import from another platform this is the most likely finding, and it shows on every card.

The fix is an update that clears it, `manage_course action: "update" id: … tag: ""` for a course,
and the same `tag: ""` through `manage_library_item` for a tutorial or guide. If the tool accepts
`import_source` and `import_ref` (check `tools/list`), move the reference there in the same
update; otherwise report the id mapping to the owner rather than keeping it in the club.

Recordings keep their labels in `tags`, which `list_content` does not return. Say that this part
of the check did not run for recordings rather than reporting them clean. And never strip a value
from `tags` that is a category name: that is how the item joins its category (check 3).

### 8. What earlier sessions already did

```
get_audit_log  source: "mcp"  limit: 50
```

Failed calls are logged with their error. A run of failures against one tool usually explains a
gap you are about to re-create. Read this before repeating a batch.

## Report shape

Per finding: what is wrong, how many items, and **who can fix it** — the owner, or Carusela.
Separate those two, because a list that mixes them leaves the owner unsure which half is
waiting on them.

End with the one-line count that matters: how many items are published and reachable by a
member at the lowest paying tier. That is the number that answers "is my club ready".
